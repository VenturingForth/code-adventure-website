                    <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-500">Personal Statement</h2>
                    <p>I am a junior software developer looking to break into his first major full-stack role exploring different tech stacks beyond web development. I rediscovered a love of problem solving and creative thinking when I moved from video engineering into coding, which stemmed from an initial belief that it would compliment an existing skill set. I strive to take great care with my work, and to justify it with honest, straightforward conversation. I look forward to expanding my knowledge into challenging spaces and applying it in the pursuit of making peopleâ€™s lives easier.</p>
